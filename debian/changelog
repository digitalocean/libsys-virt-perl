libsys-virt-perl (0.2.0-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  TODO:
  - d/rules: I don't think there's a reason for "-a"
  - I'd remove debian/libsys-virt-perl.docs, the README doesn't look helpful
    at first glance
  - d/copyright: very detailed and diligent! I'm just nor sure where the first
    statment (Files: *, 2006-2009) comes from. (I don't see a file that has
    those years but not Red Hat). [probably squashing it down to one stanza with
    "2006-2009 Daniel P. Berrange, 2006-2009 Red Hat" would also work]

  * Initial Release. (Closes: #384576)
